                <p> The Chittagong Division is known for its rich biodiversity. Over 2000 of Bangladesh's 6000 flowering
                    plants grow in the region.[54] Its hills and jungles are laden with waterfalls, fast flowing river
                    streams and elephant reserves. St. Martin's Island, within the Chittagong Division, is the only
                    coral island in the country. The fishing port of Cox's Bazar is home to one of the world's longest
                    natural beaches. In the east, there are the three hill districts of Bandarban, Rangamati, and
                    Khagrachari, home to the highest mountains in Bangladesh.</p>
